###Screen Rotation Scripts for X220T

These scripts are for rotating the screen and pen and touch interfaces for my X220T.

To run:

* Give execute permissions to 'rotatebutton', and read/write permission to 'rotationmode'
* To rotate in 90 degree increments, run 'rotatebutton'. (Or map it to a hardware button)

The trackpoint is disabled for all orientations except normal.

Tested on Ubuntu 12.10 -> 13.10, originally based on [link](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/X61T).
