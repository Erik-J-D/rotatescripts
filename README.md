###Rotate Scripts for X220T

These scripts are for rotating the screen AND pen and touch interfaces for my X220T.

To run:

* Give execute permissions to all scripts, and read/write permission to 'rotationmode'
* To rotate in 90 degree increments, run 'rotatebutton'. (Or map it to a hardware button)
* rotate\[left/right/normal/inverted\] rotates the screen to specific orientations

The trackpoint is disabled for all orientations except normal.

Tested on Ubuntu 12.10, based heavily on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/X61T
